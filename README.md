The Heart MRI Image-Left Atrial Segmentation dataset is a comprehensive collection of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data specifically focused on the segmentation of the left atrium. The dataset aims to facilitate research and development in the field of cardiac image analysis, particularly for automated segmentation.

Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of a diverse range of cardiac MRI images acquired from various clinical centers using different MRI scanners. The images were acquired from patients with a variety of cardiac conditions, including atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathies. Each image in the dataset is accompanied by corresponding expert annotations that delineate the boundaries of the left atrium.
